        <h1>New <span> Seven </span>Wonders of the World</h1>
        <p class="topic-paragraph">In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New Seven Wonders of
            the
            World. Given that the original <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Wonders-of-the-World"
                class="md-crosslink" data-show-preview="true">Seven Wonders</a> list was compiled in the 2nd century
            BCE—and
            that only one entrant is still standing (the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pyramids-of-Giza"
                class="md-crosslink" data-show-preview="true">Pyramids of Giza</a>)—it seemed time for an update. And
            people
            around the world apparently agreed, as more than 100 million votes were cast on the Internet or by text
            messaging. The final results, which were announced in 2007, were met with cheers as well as some jeers—a
            number
            of prominent contenders, such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens" class="md-crosslink"

            <p class="topic-paragraph">Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest
                building-construction
                projects, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Wall-of-China" class="md-crosslink"
                    data-show-preview="true">Great Wall of China</a> is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850
                km) long;
                a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th
                century
                BCE and continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two
                parallel
                walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great
                thing about
                the wall, however, was its effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall
                largely
                failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political
                propaganda.”

                    data-show-preview="true">Toltecs</a>—a number of important monuments and temples were
                built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24
                meters)
                above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy"
                    class="md-crosslink" data-show-preview="true">astronomical</a> abilities, the structure features a
                total of
                365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting
                sun casts
                shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the
                base is
                a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the

                among
                sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where <a

                    data-show-preview="true">Nabataeans</a>, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time
                it
                flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans
                chiseled
                dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In
                addition, they
                constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly
                had a
                population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in
                363 CE
                caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although
                rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many
                questions
                remain about the city. </p>

                likely a
                pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not be is
                the site
                of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is

                ultimately
                designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was
                completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its
                base, which
                is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest
